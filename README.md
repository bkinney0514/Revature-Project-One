# Employee Reimbursement System

The Expense Reimbursement System will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can login and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and history for all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement.

# Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/bkinney0514/Revature-Project-One.git

The Web/Java end is run through Spring Tool Suite, the SQL end is run through DBeaver using PostgreSQL.

# Usage

Be sure to run the SQL code in your database application before running the Web application.

Once the database is set up, be sure to set up a server of your choice (this project used a Tomcat Server on my end).

Run the project on the server from either the HomePage.html or by right-clicking on the Project in the project navigation.
